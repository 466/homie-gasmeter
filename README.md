# homie-utility
utility sensor based on a ESP8266 using Homie
Uses 2 Hall sensors, directly connected to a Wemos D1 mini
written in Arduino


dependencies: <a href="https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-esp8266">Homie by Marvin Roger</a> and subsequent dependencies


To do:
- testing and debugging!
- write data directly into <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a> (I'm doing it now through <a href="http://www.openhab.org/">openHAB2</a>)
- add webpage displaying current total with possibility to set value (to set starting point as on fysical utility meter)
